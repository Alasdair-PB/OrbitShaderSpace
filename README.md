# Orbit shader space

An Early Unity project- when I was first learning Shaders & IK.

Shaders: using shader graph this project creates 
* an Ocean shader that implments refraction, transparency and ripples from raindrops as well as the currents direction.
* Trees & Foliages that blow in the wind
* Icicles that hangs down from from trees & overhangs
  
The Character controller uses a full foot & hand IK systems that pushes against walls and corrects their foot placement relative to the terrain
